                                                When we were brainstorming, we came up the same ideas that we wanted to utilize ai for studying like, reviewing learning materials, creating flashcard, capable of summarization and quiz like creation. We tried researching models that fits our goals and is already pre-trained. Me and my team agreed that we should proceed with this proposal. While presenting, there wasn't any major issue aside from the time frame given. Being able to take the feasibility into account is one the things we should think through.

                                    The project proposal of Shiminet is an innovative idea in transforming the way how students engage with educational materials that outline a comprehensive plan for an AI powered academic companion tool that can automatically generate a summary of papers or books I think as well as the flashcards, and quizzes to provide a more efficient and effective reviewing. I think this approach is difficult to do since it's AI and even though we say that using BERT and GPT and then fine tuned these models for specific education contexts, it's not a small task as it involves handling large volumes of data. In short, creating this proposal could be challenging as it requires a lot of training and evaluation methods but if they executed it well this project could be a game changer for personalized learning. The paper could be improved if they provided more information about their data collection as well as providing an explanation in the timeline of the study. They use the Gantt chart but do not explain how well they will going to execute those phases in a timely manner.

                                    The proposal paper by the group Shiminet follows the correct format based on the instructions. Their proposed project addresses a significant issue in education, and the domain and specific problem are well explained in the introduction. However, the specific problem is not just limited to students but it also apllies to the teachers who make quizzes and flashcard for their students, solving their issue of making those from the scratch. I like how they explain their chosen models and metrics by providing both the rationale and advantages, which greatly support their proposal. This kind of approach, I think is better compared to other papers that only define their models and metrics without further justification. Overall, the paper demonstrates a good understanding of the NLP tasks they want to do. However, considering the limited time for the project to complete, they might consider removing the flashcard generation. If what I think about generating flashcard is right, then their system will be generating images for flashcards, and that could become a challenging and time-consuming task to make.

                                    As I was reading their proposal, it is good that they have introduced the domain of the problem by clearly explaining it. Although I think it would make it better if they had provided more related studies about their proposal, and this would justify what they are claiming. Also, using an in-text citation would make it easier for readers to find where the reference was used. From the methodology, it is good that they have explained the rationale and the advantages of the models that they will use for this project. This is helpful for readers to understand on how these models would work on the project that was proposed. Moving on to the data source, it is good that they have provided detailed explanation of every process that they will do for collecting their dataset. From their evaluation, it is good that they have provided clear explanation on what metrics that they will use for the process and the models that will be used for this project. From their timeline, I think it would be better if they have provided details on their timeline of the study. Overall, this is a good proposal, and this proposal would help a lot of students with their studies.

                                    The proposal's goals are clearly stated in relation to the problem that has been recognized the suggested solution will build NLP models that take complex information and condense it using summaries, flashcards, and quizzes for important ideas. Transformer-based models like BERT and GPT are specified under the well-developed technique section. GPT works well for making logical questions and flashcards, whereas BERT's contextual analysis is perfect for summarizing. Although taking into account all the different themes and the associated terminology in educational materials may make it difficult to extract constant accuracy, this combination of models seems to be very well justified for the goals and appropriate for the topics.
